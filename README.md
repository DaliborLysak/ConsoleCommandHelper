# ConsoleCommandHelper
Library for helping processing usual console apps commands as help, about, etc... 

Motivation
I do a lot of small console apps for geocaching and personal use and after some time not using them I usually end up reading and learning again what are app console commands. And this is because I always fail struggle to find out time to write readme or help. For that reason I write this helper.
